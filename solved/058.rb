# Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
# a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

# 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
# 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
# 39 18  5  4  3 12 29
# 40 19  6  1  2 11 28
# 41 20  7  8  9 10 27
# 42 21 22 23 24 25 26
# 43 44 45 46 47 48 49

# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
# diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
# along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
# spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
# what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes
# along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
